# bias-detection-engine

## Overview
This project is an effort to leverage technology to prevent, detect, and remediate bias and misrepresentation in the workplace, products, legal system and society. For corporations to succeed, it is critical to have Black representation at every level.

Studies have shown that in order to get in company doors that Minority job applicants are “whitening” their resumes by deleting references to their race with the hope of boosting their shot at jobs, and recent research shows the strategy is paying off. According to Forbes, in fact, companies are more than twice as likely to call minority applicants for interviews if they submit whitened resumes than candidates who reveal their race — and this discriminatory practice is just as strong for businesses that claim to value diversity as those that don’t. According to the Harvard Business Review, it shouldn’t be surprising that most diversity programs aren’t increasing diversity. Despite a few new bells and whistles, courtesy of big data, companies are basically doubling down on the same approaches they’ve used since the 1960s—which often make things worse, not better. Firms have long relied on diversity training to reduce bias on the job, hiring tests and performance ratings to limit it in recruitment and promotions, and grievance systems to give employees a way to challenge managers. Those tools are designed to preempt lawsuits by policing managers’ thoughts and actions.

## Problem Statement 
Black employees do not advance at the rate and to the levels of influence in the workplace they should due to a lack of transparency around opportunities and implicit biases in recruiting, evaluation, mentorship and promotion processes.

**Hill**: A recruiter can receive data driven recommendations of non-traditional applicants to reconsider and be confident in advocating for them to hiring managers. 

## Proposed Solution
Our solution has the following key personas:

![Personas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7343099/90186037-8fbae300-dd85-11ea-8f00-6b2c523c3c93.png)

The main persona in our solution is the recruiter who is attempting to identify candidates.

- Mechanism to anonymize / pseudonymize
- Bias measurement assets
- Data sharing
- Front-end website

## Hiring Funnel 

Systemic racism is a structural input into the hiring funnel, leading to disparities in the outputs. The hiring process is a seven-step process that includes: sourcing, application, screening, shortlist, hiring manager/interview, offer/negotiation, and candidate decision. In this solution we are not directly addressing the sourcing step, but rather focusing on the pipeline from application to being hired or dispositioned. Our hope is that by showing bias at each step along the pipeline, we can help companies understand why they may not be achieving the diversity they desire in their employee base.

## Overall Architecture

Our solution aims to have a web UI that takes in HR data (in our case, simulated data), and allows for query, selection, presentation, and visualization of that data. The critical components of our solution that we hope to provide insights on include: a visualization to represent the seven-step hiring process, a statistical analysis to indicate bias, and a simulation to model what fair results would look like.

## Extending the Bias Engine

Apart from HR hiring data, we can also apply the bias detection to the Judicial system. People in the Black community are faced with harsher downstream effects (charged at higher rates, assigned more significant charges, convicted at higher rates, given longer sentences, and denied parole more often) than people of other races for similar offenses. 

## Analysis

We have created some initial data science exploratory notebooks [here.](https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/bias-detection-engine/tree/master/notebooks)
The notebooks analyze the sample HR/Judicial data sets to depict the bias in various stages of either HR recruiting process or legal procedure for the Black community.

## Sample Data
The data sets used in our initial analysis/notebooks can be found [here.](https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/bias-detection-engine/tree/master/data)

The input HR data has been generated by our team due to privacy concerns surrounding real data. Each row in the dataset gives the applicant’s race, gender, application date, and dates for each subsequent step in the hiring process they have achieved (shortlist, interview, offer, hire). If an applicant is not hired, a date will be given for their disposition from the hiring process.  

Our model uses data from three sources of bias: 
* Adding additional bias landing at ~3% Black hires 
* No additional bias in the funnel, landing at ~7% Black hires 
* Remediation in the funnel, landing at ~13% Black hires.

We have also generated judicial data to mock real-world scenarios. Each row in the dataset gives the crime elements identified in the crime, the defendant's race, sentencing length and the corresponding step in the legal process such as **Investigation, Plea Bargaining, Pre-Trial Motions.**
