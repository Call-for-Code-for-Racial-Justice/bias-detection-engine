    "# Bias and Disparity Detection Engine Demo: Open Sentencing\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate various capabilities of the bias and disparity detection engine (BDDE) in aiding the [Open Sentencing](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Open-Sentencing) solution. The goal of Open Sentencing is to reduce racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system and the BDDE forms one part of the solution by highlighting disparities in historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we see a diagram of the steps in the criminal justice system. This demonstrates the multitude of possible outcomes and paths an accused individual may take and shows the scope of the challenge of reducing bias which may enter the system at any point in the process."
